Is there a Whisper API?

In March 2023, OpenAI made the large-v2 model available through our API, which gives faster performance than the open-source model and is priced at $0.006 / minute of transcription. Whisper API is available through transcriptions (transcribes in the source language) or translations (transcribes into English) endpoints and accepts standard audio formats like m4a, mp3, mp4 and wav. 

There are also Whisper-based APIs like Gladia, which relies on a hybrid and enhanced Whisper architecture to deliver a more extended set of capabilities and features than the official OpenAI API.
